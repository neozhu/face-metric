# Face Compare — Vision

Face Compare is a minimalist, dark‑first web app that compares two face images and returns a clear match score.

**Core flow (3 steps)**
1. User uploads or captures two face images in side‑by‑side panels.
2. User taps **Compare**.
3. App shows: large similarity %, animated ring, confidence, short hint.

**Principles**
- Dark‑first, teal/cyan accent, clean hierarchy, professional feel.
- No accounts, no history, no verbose explanations.
- Privacy‑first: images are only used for this comparison and not stored.

**Success definition**
- User can compare two faces within ~3 seconds on a typical laptop/mobile connection.
- Clear success/failure states (face detected vs. not detected).
- Output is trustworthy, concise, and consistent across devices.
